# PeruLRC
This repository is to hold my Android Programming final project for Spring 2017. The application will be used to track our itinerary while studying abroad in Peru (May 2017). Also, this application will assist with the project in Peru by allowing the user to add notes for each day like a journal and allow the user to attach pictures to the notes.
